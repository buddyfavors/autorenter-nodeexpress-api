# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct; please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Creating an Issue

Before you create a new Issue:

* Check the [Issues](https://github.com/fusionalliance/autorenter-nodeexpress-api/issues) on GitHub to ensure one doesn't already exist.
* Clearly describe the issue, including the steps to reproduce the issue.
* If it's a new feature, enhancement, or restructure, explain your reasoning on why your think it should be implemented, and also provide a supporting use case.

## Making changes

* Create a feature branch from the development branch.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace/changes with `git diff --check` before committing.
  * Also check that your code is formatted properly with spaces (hint: Use [.editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/)).
* Keep git commit messages clear and appropriate.
* Make sure you have added any tests necessary to test your code.
  * Run __all__ the tests to ensure nothing else was accidentally broken.
  * Don't rely on the existing tests to see if you've broken code elsewhere; test the changes you made in a browser too!
* Update the documentation to go along with any changes in functionality/improvements.

## Pull Request (PR) Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies that are no longer needed are removed before the end of the build.
1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface or its usage. This includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
1. Increase the version numbers in any example files and the README.md to the new version that this PR would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
1. PRs must be approved before they can be merged.
  * Merging of approved PRs to the development branch will be performed by the AutoRenter Core team.
  * Merging of approved PRs to a feature branch will typically be performed by the branch's creator.

    > **Example**: Jon creates a PR for a new feature. To fix some problems he found in Jon's branch while reviewing Jon's PR, Dave creates a new branch from Jon's branch and opens a new PR. After getting necessary approval, Dave merges his PR into Jon's branch. Then, after Jon's PR has been approved, a member of AutoRenter Core team merges Jon's PR into the development branch.

## Recommended Development Workflow

The following steps describe the recommended development workflow.

1. Pull from the `development` branch.
1. As described in the [README](README.md):
  1. Install project libraries.
  1. Run tests.
  1. Start the API.
1. Browse the API.

**If you encounter problems with any of this, please see the [Troubleshooting section](https://github.com/fusionalliance/autorenter-nodeexpress-api#troubleshooting).**

If you are implementing a new feature, in addition to the previous steps you should:

1. Create a feature branch by branching off of `development`.
1. Implement your feature. *Note that during this process you should regularly (at least 1x/day) merge the `development` branch into your feature branch to ensure your code is staying current with work being done by the rest of the team.*
  1. Develop
    1. Make changes to code, scripts, unit tests, etc.
    1. Lint your code.
    1. Run the tests.
    1. Browse the API.
    1. Repeat until you have something meaningful to commit to your feature branch.
  1. Commit changes to your feature branch.
  1. Repeat these feature implementation steps until the feature is ready to review.
1. Open a pull request to merge your feature branch into `development`.
